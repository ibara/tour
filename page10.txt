The last of the common Unix editors is nano. Nano is considered an "easy"
editor, but don't let that stop you from using it. Like Emacs, nano is a
non-modal editor. Unlike Emacs, it is not extensible.

Nano helpfully keeps a list of its commands at the bottom of the screen so that
you do not have to remember what key commands do what (this need to remember is
often cited as a major pain point for both vi and Emacs).

Nano is the least likely of the three editors to be on any random Unix system,
but it is quite popular, so chances are good it will be available.




There are literally thousands of text editors, but these are the three most
popular. You should choose one of these three to learn.

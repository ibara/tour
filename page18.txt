The last thing we need for now is how to get more help or information on a
program (and, as you will later see, many other things on the system). The
command for that is man(1), short for manual. You may have noticed that I have
been introducing many commands with (1) at the end of them. That is called
manual page notation; it is telling you how to get more information on
something should you want or need it.

You invoke man with man, followed by the number in the parentheses, followed by
the name of the thing you want to get more information on. For example, to get
more information on man itself, noting that I introduced it as man(1), you
would type "man 1 man".

You can do that for any of the commands you have seen me introduce with manual
page notation: vi(1), ls(1), tmux(1), ksh(1), cat(1), mkdir(1), less(1), mv(1),
cp(1), rm(1), bash(1).

Behind the scenes, man invokes less to read the material, so you navigate and
quit man the same way you navigate and quit less.

Another very useful command is ls(1). The ls command will give you a listing of
all the files and directories in the current working directory.

Try it yourself: quit this tour, type "ls", then return to the tour.

You may have noticed that you didn't get anything back. That's because there's
nothing in your HOME directory! We will add something now.

For organizational purposes, you may want to create your own directories inside
your HOME directory (and directories inside directories inside directories...).
The command to create new directories is mkdir(1). The easy mnemonic is "make
directory."

Try it yourself: quit this tour, type "mkdir new", type "ls", type "cd new",
type "cd", then return to this tour.

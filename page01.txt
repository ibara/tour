Welcome to ITWS 4370, Information Systems Security.

Information Security is an extremely broad field, and there are lots of
different avenues for you to explore. Regardless of where you ultimately end
up, Unix skills are going to be essential. This quick tour is designed to walk
you through a basic Unix environment and get you familiar with the command
line, or shell in Unix speak.

In this course, the Unix we will use is called OpenBSD. You may have heard of
Linux. Unix skills are transferable between different Unices. I use OpenBSD
because it is known worldwide as the world's most secure operating system, and
because I am one of the developers.

In this tour, I will encase commands in "quotes" but remove the quotes when you
try the commands yourselves.

OK, let's start by pressing n to go to the next page.

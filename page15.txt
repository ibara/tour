If tmux is running and you are finished working, you can press ^B d to detach
tmux from the terminal (you can also just close the terminal window, that will
also cause tmux to detach). Tmux will sit patiently and wait for you to return
and when you do, tmux will give you everything back just as you left it.

If you have a detached tmux session, the command to get it back is "tmux a".

Try it: press ^B d to detach then "tmux a" and you should return right back
here.

One of the true downsides of the terminal is that you only get one; so you can
only really do one thing at a time. You could get multiple terminals by logging
in multiple times, but it sure would be nice to be able to have multiple
terminals with just one login.

Fortunately, there is a program that will let us do exactly that. It is called
tmux(1). Short for "terminal multiplexer," tmux will allow you to have an
unlimited number of terminals in a single login, and provides an easy mechanism
for switching between terminals.

From now on, the first thing you should do when you log in to this machine (or
any Unix machine) is run tmux. Do that now, quit the tutorial and run tmux. You
will get a terminal with a green status bar at the bottom. Then come back here
and we will talk about how to use tmux.

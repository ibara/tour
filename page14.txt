Tmux uses the window/pane metaphor for understanding multiple terminals. Every
time we press ^B c, we create a new window with a single pane. We can also
create new panes within a window. You can create horizontally split panes and
vertically split panes and any combniation of the two to suit your preferences.

Panes are infinitely more useful if you have a large terminal window, so
maximizing the window is recommended.

To create a vertically split pane, press ^B % and to create a horizontally
split pane, press ^B ". To cycle through panes, press ^B o. So remember: to
cycle through windows, it's ^B n or ^B p. To cycle through panes, press ^B o.

To delete a pane, press ^B x (tmux will ask for confirmation). You can also
simply type exit to exit that terminal, which will delete the pane. If you
delete the last pane in a window, you will delete the window. If you delete the
last window, you will close tmux.

The first editor to discuss is vi(1). The vi editor is particularly special in
Unix: it is the one visual editor that is guaranteed to be on any Unix system,
as it is a required utility. This means that, at a minimum, you should be
familiar with the basics of vi. Because you can always be certain that no
matter where you are, you have it available to you. I use vi as my primary text
editor. When you get really good at it, you will be able to work faster in vi
than any other text editor, but it does have a huge learning curve.

vi is what is called a modal editor. This means that you can either enter text
or issue commands (like moving the cursor around, deleting text, searching),
but not both at the same time.

The vi program can be invoked by itself as "vi" in which case you will get a
blank new document. Or you can give it a file argument, in which case vi will
open that file for editing.

To quit vi, press the <ESC> key. Then type :q! and press <Enter>.
By the way, vi is pronounced as its two letters: v i. Not vee or vie.

Press n for next page; p for previous page; q to quit

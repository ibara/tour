Homework (very short!):
1. Create a new file in the text editor of your choice
2. Inside that file, write your name and RCSID
3. Save the file to yourname-yourRCSID.txt
4. Read a manual page for one program not covered in this tour.
5. Run that program and copy the output to a new file named yourRCSID-prog.txt
   (Hint: you might want to look up shell pipes and the tee(1) program)
6. Move the two files you have now to the /home/callab5 directory
   (Note: you may no longer be able to see them once you do this!)

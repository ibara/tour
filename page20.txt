A few final things:
* We have a Slack channel. It is at
  https://join.slack.com/t/itws-infosec-s20/signup
  It is imperative you sign up for this Slack!
* Some people prefer the GNU utilities. If that's you, you can prefix many
  utilities with the letter 'g' to use the GNU version. You can also use shell
  aliases in your .profile to default to any GNU utilities you prefer.
  For example, if you prefer the GNU version of ls, you can use gls(1) or you
  can set "alias ls=gls" in your .profile to default to the GNU version.
* You have a quota of 100 MB on this machine. That should be way more than
  enough. Use this server to do your coding homeworks (at a minimum).
* There are lots of utilities on this machine, and you are free to use them.
* If you want to use a different shell than ksh(1), chsh(1) is the command
  you're looking for. I personally use ksh but plenty of people use bash(1) or
  zsh(1), both of which are available.
* If you need help setting up your environment, let me know. Your shell should
  make your life easier. I prefer a minimalist approach but you don't have to!
  I can help you set up whatever works for you.

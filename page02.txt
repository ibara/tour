The shell is your interface to the world. The shell is both an interactive
environment and a programming language, though we will use it for its
interactive environment. The shell you are in now is called ksh(1). Another
popular shell is bash(1).

The shell is unfortunately a lot more terse than the GUI interfaces you may be
used to. Commands mistyped will often give you back at best a short error
message, at worst run the wrong command.

You know you are in the shell if you see an optional status message followed by
a shell character, most commonly $ (but sometimes # or even >). I have provided
you a simple status message, the current working directory of the shell. So you
should see a prompt that looks something like this:

/home/callab5 $

You will see your RCSID in place of callab5 in the line above.
This is your HOME directory. This space is yours to use how you see fit.

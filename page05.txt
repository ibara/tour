Great! Now we can navigate around the filesystem, see the contents of any
directory, and create new directories.

But how can we read files? There are several utilities that we can use to read
files. The quickest one is cat(1). The cat utility will simply blast the
contents of the file(s) you provide as arguments to the terminal, even if the
file(s) are too big to fit on the terminal. This kind of output is called
stdout. If you do not give any files to cat, it will sit and wait for you to
type stuff into the terminal. You can just press CTRL-c to quit the program in
that case.

Try it yourself: I have a short text file in my HOME directory. You can read it
by typing "cat /home/callab5/hello.txt".

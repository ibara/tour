The next editor is Emacs. vi and Emacs are the two main Unix text editors.
Emacs is a non-modal editor, meaning that you can type text and issue commands
at the same time. Emacs is an incredibly extensible editor, meaning that you
can write your own extensions for Emacs to increase its functionality. The old
joke is that "Emacs is a great operating system without a good text editor"
because there are extensions to do just about everything. It is a good bet that
any Unix machine will have Emacs on it, but it is not a required program like
vi is, so you may occasionally find a Unix machine without Emacs.

Like vi (or any text editor), you can invoke Emacs by itself as "emacs" which
will give you a blank new document or invoke Emacs with a file argument to open
that file for editing.

To quit Emacs, press CTRL-x followed by CTRL-c.
In Unix parlance, CTRL is abbreviated as ^. So another way to write the quit
command is ^X^C (the letters are capitalized even though you don't use the
Shift key, it's just the convention).
By the way, OpenBSD has a mini version of Emacs called mg(1).

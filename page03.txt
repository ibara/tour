You can change the current working directory with the cd command. When you
change the current working directory, the shell prompt will update to remind
you where you are.

The cd command also has a few special options. If you type "cd" all by itself,
then you will return to your HOME directory. If you type "cd -" then you will
return to the directory you were most previously in. So you can use "cd -" over
and over to quickly move back and forth between two directories.

Try it yourself: quit this tour, type "cd /home" and notice that your shell
prompt has now changed. Then type "cd" to return to your HOME directory, then
come back to this tour to continue.

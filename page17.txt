You will be writing C code for this course. This means using a C compiler. The
C compiler on this machine is cc(1), and it is the clang compiler from the LLVM
project. It is a standard C compiler that will do everything you need it to.
Clang is one of the industry standard C/C++ compilers; Apple, Android, and
Microsoft all use it to compile their code. You should too.

The basic invocation of the C compiler in this course, for example assuming you
have a C source code file named hw1.c, is as follows:

cc -O0 -pipe -g -o hw1 hw1.c

Don't worry if you don't understand what all the flags mean just yet. There is
a more in-depth explanation here:

To invoke the newly created program, run "./hw1".

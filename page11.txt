Here are some handy utilities to manipulate files and directories.

The mv(1) command renames a file or directory. It is used like so:
"mv oldname newname"

The cp(1) command copies a file:
"cp original copy"

The rm(1) command deletes a file:
"rm file"

The rm command can also be used on directories. When deleting a directory, we
have to add the -r flag as an argument:
"rm -r directory"
Be careful! Deleting a directory will also delete all files and directories
inside that directory.

Most utilities have flags that change behaviors. Experiment! (try "ls -l")
